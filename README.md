# GYM - my first milestone project - a site showing all of the benefits and features of our gym.
[Link to finished site](https://craigmantona.github.io/GYM-project/)

This is my GYM website that I have made by using the skills and code from the course so far (Love running, CV, Whiskey Drop to mention a few.)

This website has been made with an established gym in mind. I have tried to make a website that is easy to access, and that has similar visuals/colour themes throughout. It should be fully accessible on a range of devices and simple to navigate for new GYM users and regular members.
I have visited several gym sites in my life and I have tried to encourporate all of the information that I considered to be vital. I have asked some friends and family for their input, and have added some extra features as a result of that interaction.

* ### Design
    * Colour Scheme
        * The two main colours used are tomato, and #343a40 a dark grey colour.

* ### Typography
    * The Merriweather font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Merriweather is a clean and clear font, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

## Testing

I got my wife to test the site as a 'new visitor'. Some styling ideas were put forward resulting in some font colour changes and a different look to the gym classes descriptions view.
My mentor also looked through it when I was part way through and gave many tips and helpful input to make a neater site.
