# GYM - my first milestone project - a site showing all of the benefits and features of our gym.
[Link to finished site](https://craigmantona.github.io/GYM-project/)

This is my GYM website that I have made by using the skills and code from the course so far (Love running, CV, Whiskey Drop to mention a few.)

This website has been made with an established gym in mind. I have tried to make a website that is easy to access, and that has similar visuals/colour themes throughout. It should be fully accessible on a range of devices and simple to navigate for new GYM users and regular members.
I have visited several gym sites in my life and I have tried to encourporate all of the information that I considered to be vital. I have asked some friends and family for their input, and have added some extra features as a result of that interaction.

* ### Design
    * Colour Scheme
        * The two main colours used are tomato, and #343a40 a dark grey colour.

* ### Typography
    * The Merriweather font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Merriweather is a clean and clear font, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to know where the GYM is located and the opening times. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

        1. Once the new visitor has read the Opening Hours text and seen the Location map, they will notice What classes we have to offer and when.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.
        4. The user can see all of the equipment that the GYM has to offer at the GYM.

        2. They will also be able to see what equipment the GYM has to offer.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
        2. Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
        3. The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page as well as the organization's telephone number.
        4. Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
        5. The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook and Instagram link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.

        1. The Facebook and Instagram pages can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.

## Testing

I got my wife to test the site as a 'new visitor'. Some styling ideas were put forward resulting in some font colour changes and a different look to the gym classes descriptions view.
My mentor also looked through it when I was part way through and gave many tips and helpful input to make a neater site.
