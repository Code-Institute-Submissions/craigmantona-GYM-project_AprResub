# GYM - my first milestone project - a site showing all of the benefits and features of our gym.
[Link to finished site](https://craigmantona.github.io/GYM-project/)

This is my GYM website that I have made by using the skills and code from the course so far (Love running, CV, Whiskey Drop to mention a few.)

This website has been made with an established gym in mind. I have tried to make a website that is easy to access, and that has similar visuals/colour themes throughout. It should be fully accessible on a range of devices and simple to navigate for new GYM users and regular members.
I have visited several gym sites in my life and I have tried to encourporate all of the information that I considered to be vital. I have asked some friends and family for their input, and have added some extra features as a result of that interaction.

## Testing

I got my wife to test the site as a 'new visitor'. Some styling ideas were put forward resulting in some font colour changes and a different look to the gym classes descriptions view.
My mentor also looked through it when I was part way through and gave many tips and helpful input to make a neater site.
